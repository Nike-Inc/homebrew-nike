# Nike Homebrew Tap

Homebrew formula for Nike OSS projects.

## What is Homebrew?

Homebrew is an OSX specific application that allows users to install applications that didn't come with Apple's operating system.

## What is a "tap" and what does it contain?

A tap in Homebrew is a third-party distribution channel that allows developers to provide installation scripts for their packages that, for one reason or another, are not eligible to be listed in the primary Homebrew distribution channel.

These taps are simply git repositories that contain Ruby scripts implementing the Homebrew installation interface.

## What should live in Nike's tap?

Any project under the Nike-Inc GitHub banner that provides an installable binary or script.

## Installation

To use formula's from Nike OSS projects, you'll need to add this tap to Homebrew:

```sh
brew tap nike-inc/nike
```
